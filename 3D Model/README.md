# Simulator construction parts
Here, you can access the models developed to build the simulator. The piece called "abdomen" contains the edited abdominal anatomical structure of a 7 year old child. This piece has been drilled through the entire surface to allow the entry of training tools. These holes have been positioned in order to provide access to different organs to facilitate the application to various surgical specialties as shown in Figure 1.
