# Simulator construction parts
Here, you can access the models developed to build the simulator. The piece called "abdomen" contains the edited abdominal anatomical structure of a 7 year old child. This piece has been drilled through the entire surface to allow the entry of training tools. These holes have been positioned in order to provide access to different organs to facilitate the application to various surgical specialties as shown in Figure 1. On the inner surface of this structure, LED lights can be placed to improve vision in training.

The piece called "base" consists of a structure that fits with the structure of the abdomen as shown in Figure 2. This piece holds the training modules and contains an opening on the right side to accommodate the switch that controls the LED lights. The depth of this piece has been developed in order to imitate the insufflation of the abdomen during laparoscopic surgery.
